# Number to Word Converter

This is a simple Python script that converts a numeric input between 0 and 100 into its word representation. For example, it can convert `42` into `forty-two`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/akshaykumargn/Number-to-Word-Converter.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Number-to-Word-Converter
3. Run the script with an integer argument to convert to words. For example:
   Number_to_word.py 42
   
Replace `42` with any integer between 0 and 100.

## Usage

- Run the script `Number_to_word.py` with a valid integer as a command-line argument to convert the number to its word representation.
The script will display the word representation of the integer.

- If the provided number is out of the valid range (0-100) or not a valid integer, appropriate error messages will be displayed.
